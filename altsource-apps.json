(#262) \r\n* Running as 64bit application on Windows is supported now (#234)\r\n* Polish translation is available now (#207)\r\n* CX II (/-T/CAS) calculators can now be emulated (#165)! However, with the current dumping programs you will not get a complete bootrom and booting the OS will fail.\r\n\r\n**Improvements:**\r\n* Multiple files can be sent in the Mobile UI and by dropping them into the main window on desktop (#279)\r\n Reimplemented emulation speed control: Now it's more accurate, especially on Windows\r\n* GitHub actions now performs automated builds for Android (armeabi-v7a and arm64-v8a in one APK), macOS and Windows (32bit and 64bit) on releases and pull requests (#283, #284, #285)\r\n* The \"installer\" for OS 4.5.3.14 (and later?) works now. It requires [fastboot RAM](https://hackspire.org/index.php?title=Memory-mapped_I/O_ports_on_CX#90030000_-_Fastboot_RAM) to persist state across reboots, which is now implemented.\r\n* More accurate emulation of the On button: It's now possible to enter Press-To-Test mode (#271)\r\n* Faster saving and loading of snapshots (#231)\r\n* More reliable USB file transfers\r\n* The debugger console now includes entered commands in the log\r\n* Support for PIE (position-independent executables) on x86_64. Previously, care needed to be taken that PIE was disabled, otherwise it would crash on start. (#211)\r\n* Building the JIT is disabled automatically if the platform does not support it (#197)\r\n* Firebird builds on FreeBSD now (#228, #248)\r\n\r\n**Bugfixes:**\r\n* File access on Android got fixed (#202 and its various duplicates)\r\n* Fix placement of keypad buttons in the touchpad area (#41)\r\n* Various fixes for the Mobile UI layout (#201)\r\n* The kit configuration page in the Mobile UI no longer causes the keyboard to pop up by default (#257)\r\n* Connecting with GDB on windows works now (#259, #260)\r\n* Some shades of grey were not displayed properly when emulating pre-CX models (#270)\r\n* Fix crash on AArch64/arm64 when executing certain instructions\r\n* The keypad reacts to touch events in the desktop version as well now (#292, #293)\r\n* Some places were no longer translated correctly after the introduction of language switching in 1.5\r\n* Keys could get stuck on focus changes. Now they're all released when the keypad loses focus (#287)\r\n* The Ctrl key now changes color when pressed\r\n* Emulation speed no longer remains unlimited after a failed file transfer\r\n\r\n_Repo for Arch, Debian, Fedora, Ubuntu and openSUSE: [via OBS](https://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home%3AVogtinator%3Afirebird-emu&package=firebird-emu&locale=en)._\r\n\r\nThere is work in progress to implement and improve support for running in the browser on Qt for WebAssembly (#294). A preview is available on https://nspire-emus.github.io/firebird/wasm/\n\nNOTE: BundleIdentifier changed in this version and automatic updates have been disabled until manual install occurs.",
